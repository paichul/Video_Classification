# Efficient Video Classification
This project provides a video classification module that has a classification accuracy of 60%-70% and can perform the video
classification task in less than 8 seconds for videos of any duration. This module can benefit mobile device computing as well as processing billions of videos on the fly.

# Features
- Uniform Video Frame Sampling
- Convolutional Neural Network Feature Extraction for Each Frame
- Video-Level Information Aggregation Using LSTM

# Files & Instructions
- extract_frames_uniform.py (can be found in the data folder): this is a utility tool that can be used to uniformally sample frames from each video. To use this uitlity tool, type in the command line:

"python extract_frames.uniform.py"

Once the frames are extracted, then the next step is to extract the CNN features for the sampled frames of a video.
